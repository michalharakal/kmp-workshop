They should not only be safe, reliable and slim \u2013 they should also be modern, good-looking and networked. In this hands-on workshop, we'll build a simple JVM desktop app that communicates with a real device (Arduino) and look at the strengths of Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform. We will learn how to easily support multiple platforms (desktop and mobile, especially with a focus on Apple operating systems) without compromising, how Kotlin and the JVM work well together and how declarative UI frameworks, such as Jetpack Compose and Swift UI, are the kind and changing the way responsive user interfaces are designed today.
