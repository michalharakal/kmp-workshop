#  Set up an environment

##  Prerequisites

!!! note
To write iOS-specific or macOS-specific code  and run it as a native iOS or macOS application on a simulated or real device, you'll need a Mac with macOS. This cannot be performed on other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows. This is an Apple requirement.

##  Install the required software


### IntelliJ IDEA

* **Recommended**: Current version of IntelliJ IDEA
* **or** Android Studio with KMM plugin


NOTE: Also make sure that **Android SDK** has been installed.
**Android SDK** can be installed via menu item **Tools->Android->SDK Manager**


## iOS and macOS

Xcode 14 or later is required to develop for iOS. A (free) Apple Developer account is required to deploy onto a device.
We recommend to install the [TouchLab Kotlin Plugin for Xcode](https://github.com/touchlab/xcode-kotlin) by running: `brew install xcode-kotlin`
