Thank you for attending our workshop. We hope you enjoyed it and learned something new. Thank you for your feedback and questions.

Here collection of ideas, hints from attendees.

* Use IntelliJ IDEA Templates for adding or replacing of a bigger chunks of code. It's quite hard to do it manually by typing up from the slides. Possible solution is to [save existing project as a template](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/saving-project-as-template.html#save-as-template) or use existing ones, as for example official ones
    *  https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-desktop-template
    * https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-web-template
    * https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-template
    * its empty now, but quite a new, lets if it will be filled with some templates https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-ios-android-template
* usage of keyword `as` as ["Unsafe" cast operator](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/typecasts.html#unsafe-cast-operator) for "readonly" value holder types in the repository implementation 
* add requirements on `cocoapods` in the [setup](setup.md)
